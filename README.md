# Dashboard ATP tour/ Overall summary 1968-2022 tab

<div style="text-align: justify">
This dashboard was created as part of our "Data Processing and Valuation" course. Our team created the Overall summary 1968-2022 tab of the dashboard to provide a global summary of all ATP single matches between 1968 and 2022, except for the Davis Cup, Masters Cup, Tour Finals, WCT challenge Cup, and Masters matches. Our team consists of: Yahia KASMI and Oumaima GHENNAMI as tennis experts, Ismael Djoulde DIALLO as Development Manager, Szymon SZPUNAR as Data Manipulation Manager, Aliz√©e SCHOLLHORN-LEOPOLD as Data Visualization Manager, and Eustache Adrien BIKEGNE BI TOUTOUME as Test/Integration Manager. All team members are available on LinkedIn and will be happy to discuss their work. The Overall summary 1968-2022 tab of the dashboard presents: a map showing the number of ATP matches played by city of the tournament location, by hovering over a point on the map (a city) you can see the name of the Grand Slam tournament (Roland Garros in Paris, France, Wimbledon in London, UK, US Open in the USA and the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia) played in the country where the city is located, you can also find out if ATP 1000, 500 or 250 tournaments are played in the city as well as the total number of professional ATP matches since 1968. Just below the map is a chart showing the evolution of prize money for the 4 Grand Slam tournaments. The annual evolution of the number of ATP players since 1968 is also presented in another chart. Finally, there is a last chart showing the number of Grand Slams won by Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, these three players are considered the top 3 ATP players, they are the "Big three" players. We present a table showing the introduction of rules over the year on tennis court equipment and surfaces, game rules and competition rules and the ATP points system, as well as value boxes presenting some statistics. The ATP match data used in this work was cloned from the https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp.git repository by Jeff Sackmann, we thank him for his work. We thank our professor Philippe REGNAULT for allowing us to develop our skills in data processing and valuation and especially for sharing his passion for tennis with us.
